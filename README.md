# London Ju Jitsu new website
My teacher told me he was waiting for is new website to come out for 3 years now, so I asked him to do it as my final project.

## User story
For futur students, they can have all the information as news and events, instructors, location, history and of course where to find us. For students, they can login/signin(log out) to be able to purchase videos and download them as much as they want.

## Wire-Frames
Current Website: http://www.londonjujitsu.com/Index.htm

The website exemple (started by someone else): http://ljj.shinchy.com/

## Outside ressources
- Stripe
- Rails
- React

## Project schedule
MVP : Fully funtional web site, and fully functional purchase/payment system.

As a stretch, I would like to allow my teacher to have an admin user, so he can make changes to the website as much as he wants.
